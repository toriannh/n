Subject: Summarization Model Results from 10Q Analysis

Dear Eldar, Suzanne, and Richard,

I hope you all had a great weekend.

In our previous discussions, we reviewed extractive NLP models that highlight sentences with the greatest relevancy and importance. I have now run abstractive models on the sentences pulled from the 10Q based on the key words. The attached Excel spreadsheet, "Abstract_results.xlsx," contains several abstract summarization models and the output in the subsequent row for each column.

I understand that we are still in the process of capturing the nuanced and insightful information in the 10Q using the extractive models, but I wanted to go ahead and show you the summarization results so far.

I think once we improve the pipeline to pull sentences that provide deeper insights and valuable context, we can use those sentences to enhance the output for the abstractive summarization results.

Thank you, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
