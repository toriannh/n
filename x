Sure! Below is a comprehensive README file that covers everything we've done so far, from extracting text with a specific font size from an HTML document to generating a word cloud and displaying summarization results in a tabular format.

Text Extraction and Summarization with Word Cloud Generation
This project demonstrates how to extract text from an HTML document based on specific font size, perform text summarization using different algorithms, and generate a word cloud from the extracted text. The project includes the following steps:

Extracting text with a specific font size from an HTML document.
Summarizing text using LexRank and spaCy with pyTextRank.
Displaying the summarization results in a markdown table.
Generating a word cloud from the extracted text.
